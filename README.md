# SNES_to_NES
This project is an adapter board designed to be installed inside a SNES gamepad.
The source is written in assembly for the AT90S1200 MCU. All code is in the main ASM file.
All the project details can be inferred from the source file, which is short, simple, and well commented. READ IT FIRST ASK STUPID QUESTIONS NEVER.
PCB design comming soon (maybe).
